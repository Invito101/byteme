# Team 39 - ByteMe - Restaurant Management System

## Overview

The Restaurant Management System (RMS) is a user-friendly application designed for managing food orders and menu items. It provides two distinct user interfaces: one for customers to place orders and view total costs, and another for admins to manage the menu and current orders. The system also stores order records in a CSV file for easy access and management.

## Features

   - **Order Placement**: Customers can select items, see the total cost and place an order.

2. **Admin Interface**

   - **Order Management**: Admins can view current orders and mark them as completed.

3. **Selection Interface**
